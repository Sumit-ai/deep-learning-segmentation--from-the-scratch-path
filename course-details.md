This is the description we show on the course page [here](https://lab.github.com/Sumit-ai/deep-learning-segmentation:-from-the-scratch). This first paragraph will be featured at the top of the page so make it great.

In this course, we will study the basics of Deep Learning. Generally, in other courses, the rule is first theory and then practical. In this course, I will try to cover both parts simultaneously. We will follow the learning by doing approach.

This course is divided into the 5 lessons: Every course will have one in-class coding assignment.
